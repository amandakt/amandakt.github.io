                        <p> Hello! My name is Amanda Tong. I am currently an Electrical Engineering student studying at the Univeristy of Waterloo. 
                            I'm a problem solver and am passionate about technology and electrical circuits. With my passion, I have  
                            helped youth learn about the world of technology by introducing them to robotics, block coding, and game design and development 
                            in games such as Minecraft and Roblox. 
                        </p>   
    
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>
                            I am also someone who loves to create and design, whether that be through 
                            learning to draw electric and mechanical systems, web development, or even my interest and hobby in art! In fact, I have 
                            recently found an interest in learning AutoCAD and developing websites in my free time. I look forward to developing these skills 
                            and use my creativity, problem-solving, and technical knowledge to collaborate with a team that can make a big impact on society.
                        </p>
