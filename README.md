## About

### Hello! My name is Amanda Tong. 

I am an <b>Electrical Engineering </b> student studying at the <b> University of Waterloo</b>. 
I'm a problem solver and am passionate about technology and electrical circuits. With my passion, I have  
helped youth learn about the world of technology by introducing them to robotics, block coding, and 3D game design/modelling 
through games such as <em>Minecraft</em> and <em> Roblox </em>. 



I am also someone who loves to create and design! This could be through learning to draw electric and mechanical systems, 
web development, or even my interest and hobby in art! In my free time, outside of school, I found an interest in learning AutoCAD 
and developing websites. I look forward to developing these skills and use my creativity, problem-solving, and technical knowledge 
to collaborate with a team that can make a big impact on society.
